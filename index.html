                            <p>During this project, we had to think about a innovative concept and make an unique interface. Plus,the project should come from the combination of three themes : time, space and interface design. My project is about the constrast of classic and night mode in interfaces and help for time zone. With the map, you can add a lot of people from various places and see instantly if they are available or not based on the time and it's representation on the map (day/night background).

Plus, it could alert you when something is wrong.
